      <h2>About us</h2>

      <p>Hearth & Honey Bakery began with a simple belief: that warm, handcrafted food has the power to bring people together. Our team uses traditional baking methods, slow fermentation, and thoughtfully sourced ingredients to create breads and pastries with depth, character, and comfort. Every loaf, croissant, and cake is made in small batches to ensure quality and consistency. </p>
      <p>We draw inspiration from the warmth of a neighborhood kitchen — a place where good smells, good company, and good stories overlap. The bakery’s design reflects this spirit, blending soft textures, natural materials, and a calm, minimal aesthetic. Whether you’re stopping by early in the morning or winding down in the afternoon, we want the space to feel familiar and welcoming.</p>
      <p>At Hearth & Honey, we focus on flavor first. Our breads are shaped by long fermentation and simple, honest ingredients. Our pastries balance richness with subtle sweetness, and our desserts follow the rhythm of the seasons. We believe that great food doesn’t need to be complicated; it just needs care, time, and intention.</p>
      <p>More than a bakery, we hope to be part of your everyday rituals. From weekday breakfasts to weekend treats, from a quick cup of coffee to a moment of calm between errands, we want every visit to feel like a small pause — something warm, comforting, and worth returning to. That’s the heart behind Hearth & Honey: warm loaves, sweet moments.</p>
