            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Dario's Bakery</p>

            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The Dario’s Bakery site is used by people who want fresh bread, pastries, desserts, and coffee—mostly local residents and families, commuters or students looking for a quick breakfast, and food lovers who care about quality, plus a secondary group like office managers and event hosts who need larger orders or catering. Their main goals are to quickly find the menu and prices, confirm hours and location, and figure out the easiest way to order or contact the bakery for custom items. They visit the site to plan a stop-in, decide what to buy ahead of time, place an order for pickup, check for specials, or get details for events like cake orders and pastry boxes.</p><!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->

					<h1>About Us</h1><!-- Home, About us, Contact, etc. -->
				
					<p>At Dario’s Bakery, we believe the best days start with something fresh from the oven. What began as a love for traditional baking and Italian-inspired flavors has grown into a neighborhood bakery built on simple ingredients, time-honored techniques, and the joy of sharing good food. Every morning, our team mixes, folds, proofs, and bakes in small batches so each loaf, pastry, and dessert tastes as warm and welcoming as the shop itself.</p>
			  
                    <p>We’re proud to be a place where regulars feel known, newcomers feel at home, and the smell of bread makes you slow down for a moment. Whether you’re stopping in for espresso and a croissant, picking up a crusty loaf for dinner, or ordering something special for a celebration, we’re here to make it memorable. Thanks for supporting local baking—see you at the counter.</p>
